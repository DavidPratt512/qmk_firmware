# QMK Fork

This is my fork of [qmk_firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware).

## Keyboards

Other keyboard configs are kept on other branches (in parentheses):

* kbdfans/niu_mini (niu_mini)
* **keebio/iris** (iris)
* pauperboards/brick (brick)
* planck (planck)

I'm using different branches to effectively pin the version of qmk each board
is built with.
